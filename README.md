# Binary Search Tree

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree in which all the nodes follow these properties:
	 − The left sub-tree of a node has r key less than or equal to its parent node's key. 
	- The right sub-tree of a node has a key greater than to its parent node's key

left_subtree (keys)  ≤  node (key)  ≤  right_subtree (keys)
